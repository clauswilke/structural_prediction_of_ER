	This folder contains Contact Number summary values (CN) for each amino acid (AA) of each protein structure that have MD simulation trajectories. The total number of MD trajectories are 1500 frames for each structure. The first line of data, represented by frame 0, corresponds to the crystal structure taken from the protein data bank.
	
	CN is defined by Franzosa and Xia (2009) as the number of alpha carbons (CA) that are closer than 13 angstroms to the alpha carbon of the desired amino acid. The file extensions cn13, highlight the distance used for the calculation of CN.

	Each row in every *.cn13 file represents the cn13 of the protein amino acids for the MD trajectory frame which is determined by its number in the first column, followed by the cn13 values for each amino acid.
	the cn13 files are obtained using the Fortran (2008) source codes that are in the subdirectory 'src'.
	
	To compile the Fortran code and create the executable on TACC, use the following command:
	
		> ifort main_dynamic_cn.f90 -o main_dynamic_cn.o
	
	To run the code type:
	
		> main_dynamic_cn.o
		
	The code will automatically inform the user about the required command-line input file names in order to generate the cn13 values.
	
	The first two moments (mean and variance and median + median + cn13 from crystal structure) of the cn13 values from MD trajectories for each protein residue are summarized in the corresponding summary files in the subdirectory 'cn13_summaries'.

		The input pdb file to the code must be the modified pdb file generated by Amber that has ALL the atoms added to the original pdb structure prior to the MD simulation. A qualified pdb file is the one with a file name that ends with either *_bres.pdb or *_amber.pdb. The former is preferred as the input, since the generated output pdb file by the code will then have three-letter amino acid names that are consistent with and recognized by other software packages such as VMD.
